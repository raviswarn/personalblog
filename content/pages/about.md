Hi! My name is Michael Toth, and I'm a data scientist living in New York City.

I try to keep my blog updated with posts about data analysis, data visualization, and programming projects I'm working on. Some of these are interesting side projects I'm exploring and some of them are solutions to challenging real-world problems that I've tackled at work. I hope they'll be helpful and interesting to you!

I graduated from the Northeastern University, where I concentrated in IT Management, I didn MS in concentrated in statistics and Econometrics.
